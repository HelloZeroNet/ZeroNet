# ZeroNet documentation
This should serve as a way to start documenting all features of ZeroNet when new code is added.

## Structure
We have some subfolders:
* `howto`: Answers to simple and frequently asked questions or basic tutorials
* `core`: Documentation about internals of core code
* `plugins`: Documentation for plugins (usage and internals)
* `features`: Documentation about features and enhancement to core

## Writing new documentation
Please copy the [template file](TEMPLATE.md) and edit it accordingly.
