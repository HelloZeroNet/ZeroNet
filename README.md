# ZeroNet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet) [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-faq-brightgreen.svg)](https://zeronet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/faq/) [![Help](https://img.shields.io/badge/keep_this_project_alive-donate-yellow.svg)](https://zeronet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/help_zeronet/donate/)

Decentralized websites using Bitcoin crypto and the BitTorrent network - https://zeronet.io


## Why?

* We believe in open, free, and uncensored network and communication.
* No single point of failure: Site remains online so long as at least 1 peer is
  serving it.
* No hosting costs: Sites are served by visitors.
* Impossible to shut down: It's nowhere because it's everywhere.
* Fast and works offline: You can access the site even if Internet is
  unavailable.


## Features
 * Real-time updated sites
 * Namecoin .bit domains support
 * Easy to setup: unpack & run
 * Clone websites in one click
 * Password-less [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)
   based authorization: Your account is protected by the same cryptography as your Bitcoin wallet
 * Built-in SQL server with P2P data synchronization: Allows easier site development and faster page load times
 * Anonymity: Full Tor network support with .onion hidden services instead of IPv4 addresses
 * TLS encrypted connections
 * Automatic uPnP port opening
 * Plugin for multiuser (openproxy) support
 * Works with any browser/OS


## How does it work?

* After starting `zeronet.py` you will be able to visit zeronet sites using
  `http://127.0.0.1:43110/{zeronet_address}` (eg.
  `http://127.0.0.1:43110/1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D`).
* When you visit a new zeronet site, it tries to find peers using the BitTorrent
  network so it can download the site files (html, css, js...) from them.
* Each visited site is also served by you.
* Every site contains a `content.json` file which holds all other files in a sha512 hash
  and a signature generated using the site's private key.
* If the site owner (who has the private key for the site address) modifies the
  site, then he/she signs the new `content.json` and publishes it to the peers.
  Afterwards, the peers verify the `content.json` integrity (using the
  signature), they download the modified files and publish the new content to
  other peers.

  * [Linux 32bit](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroBundle/raw/master/dist/ZeroBundle-linux32.tar.gz)
* Unpack anywhere
* Run `ZeroNet.cmd` (win), `ZeroNet(.app)` (osx), `ZeroNet.sh` (linux)

If you get "classic environment no longer supported" error on OS X: Open a Terminal window and drop ZeroNet.app on it

It downloads the latest version of ZeroNet then starts it automatically.

### Linux terminal

* `wget https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroBundle/raw/master/dist/ZeroBundle-linux64.tar.gz`
* `tar xvpfz ZeroBundle-linux64.tar.gz`
* `cd ZeroBundle`
* Start with `./ZeroNet.sh`

It downloads the latest version of ZeroNet then starts it automatically.

#### Manual install for Debian Linux

* `sudo apt-get update`
* `sudo apt-get install msgpack-python python-gevent`
* `wget https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/archive/master.tar.gz`
* `tar xvpfz master.tar.gz`
* `cd ZeroNet-master`
* Start with `python zeronet.py`

## Current limitations

* No torrent-like file splitting for big file support
* ~~No more anonymous than Bittorrent~~ (built-in full Tor support added)
* File transactions are not compressed ~~or encrypted yet~~ (TLS encryption added)
* No private sites


## How can I create a ZeroNet site?

Shut down zeronet if you are running it already

```bash
$ zeronet.py siteCreate
...
- Site private key: 23DKQpzxhbVBrAtvLEc2uvk7DZweh4qL3fn3jpM3LgHDczMK2TtYUq
- Site address: 13DNDkMUExRf9Xa9ogwPKqp7zyHFEqbhC2
...
- Site created!
$ zeronet.py
...
```

Congratulations, you're finished! Now anyone can access your site using
`http://localhost:43110/13DNDkMUExRf9Xa9ogwPKqp7zyHFEqbhC2`

## How can I modify a ZeroNet site?

* Modify files located in data/13DNDkMUExRf9Xa9ogwPKqp7zyHFEqbhC2 directory.
  After you're finished:

```bash
$ zeronet.py siteSign 13DNDkMUExRf9Xa9ogwPKqp7zyHFEqbhC2
- Signing site: 13DNDkMUExRf9Xa9ogwPKqp7zyHFEqbhC2...
Private key (input hidden):
```

* Enter the private key you got when you created the site, then:

```bash
$ zeronet.py sitePublish 13DNDkMUExRf9Xa9ogwPKqp7zyHFEqbhC2
...
Site:13DNDk..bhC2 Publishing to 3/10 peers...
Site:13DNDk..bhC2 Successfuly published to 3 peers
- Serving files....
```

* That's it! You've successfully signed and published your modifications.
